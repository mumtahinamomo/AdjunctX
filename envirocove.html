    <p class="text-gray-800 text-base leading-relaxed">Envirocove is currently operating as a beta-stage B2B multi-vendor marketplace that connects vendors and technicians for the sale and purchase of new, pre-owned and reusable electronic components and parts. The platform aims to address a critical gap in Bangladesh’s electronics repair ecosystem, where millions of MSMEs struggle to find on-demand, affordable parts—often relying on expensive imports or informal markets. Envirocove enables verified vendors to list pre-owned and reusable components, making them accessible to thousands of repair businesses and technical enterprises across the country. Currently, the platform has onboarded 600+ vendors and reached 32,000+ repairing enterprises through pilot projects in key divisional cities. With a focus on empowering the circular economy, Envirocove facilitates the reuse of electronics and helps reduce e-waste. Alongside the digital marketplace, the team is building partnerships with supply channels, technical segregators, recycling companies, logistics and social organizations to scale operations and streamline logistics for reusable electronics distribution nationwide.</p>
