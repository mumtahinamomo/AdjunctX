      Nirbhoya is a women-led initiative transforming menstrual and reproductive health in Bangladesh, particularly targeting remote and marginalized communities. Millions of women lack essential awareness related to their menstrual, mental and reproductive health, related resources, and affordable hygiene products; Nirbhoya bridges these gaps through education, economic empowerment, and technology. 
      <br><br>
      Our activities include community-based awareness sessions, having reached nearly 3,000 tea worker women through 40 courtyard meetings in Sreemangal led by medical professionals. Concurrently, Nirbhoya is researching menstrual and reproductive health practices in tea estates to design impactful interventions.
      <br><br>
      Our sustainable social enterprise empowers marginalized women to produce reusable sanitary pads, with proceeds supporting education for girls in tea garden communities. Additionally, Nirbhoya has developed an AI-based mobile app that offers a complete, bilingual health solution â€” covering menstrual, mental, and reproductive health. 
      <br><br>
      Recognized with prestigious awards, Nirbhoya won the Empowered Youth Labour Force Hackathon and Save The Children's Women Innovation Challenge, became an international finalist at the Youth Startup Summit, and won the Global YCM Challenge 2025 in the Human Rights category.
